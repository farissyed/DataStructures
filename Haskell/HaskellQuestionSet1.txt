1) Calculate the maximum value out of any 5 numbers.

    xs = [2,1,4,6,3]
    maximum xs
    6

2) Calculate the maximum value between any 2 numbers two different ways (intending
you to use infix notation).

    max 2 8
    8
    2 `max` 8
    8

3) Calculate the next higher number than any negative number (for instance, -5 -> -4)

    succ (-5)
    -4

4) Write a function which will return the squared value of any number.

    square x = x^2

5) Write a function which will return the sum of any two numbers.

    sum' x y = x + y

6) Write a function which will find the sum of any four numbers, but use #5's function
to do it.

    sum4 a b c d = sum (sum a b) (sum c d)

7) Write a function which will calculate your letter grade in a class given a particular
grade% as a parameter: >=90 A, >= 80 B, >= 70 C, >= 60 D, others F

    grade x = if x>=90 then "A" else if x>=80 then "B" else if x>=70 then "C" else if x>=60 then "D" else "F"

8) Calculate a list that contains 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9

    pi = [3,1,4,1,5,9]
    pi
    [3,1,4,1,5,9]

9) Calculate the first letter in any string

    head "Hello"
    'H'

10) Calculate a list that can store this matrix:
	3 1 4 1 5
	9 2 6 5 3
	5 8 9 7 9

    xs = [[3,1,4,1,5],[9,2,6,5,3],[5,8,9,7,9]]

11) Write a function which adds a given parameter to the end of a given list.

    appendEnd xs y = xs ++ [y]

12) Write a function which adds a given parameter to the beginning of a given list.

    appendBeg xs y = [y] ++ xs

13) What is the tail of "bubba"?

   tail "bubba"
   "ubba"

14) What is the init of "bubba"?

   init "bubba"
   "bubb"

15) What is the head of "bubba"?

   head "bubba"
   'b'

16) What is the last of "bubba"?

   last "bubba"
   'a'
